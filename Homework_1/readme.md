# Homework_1 Tech Report

Its been while since I last coded so this took me some time to figure out some of the basic setups.

I had some trouble remembering which code goes in which place whether it be the index.html of the .css file. Once I realized you must <a href="" your style sheet and then you can go on to making <divs> of <sections> and style out from there. Its pretty interesting stuff, although very frustrating sometimes!

I think my biggest issue was mu pushing to master from my github desktop took some time. I would write code and push and try and refresh and expect a result immediately. But it would typically take 1-2 minutes to adjust and I would have tried to write something different believing whatever I wrote was incorrect.

On the the syllabus it says we must cite our code we have used from other websites. I made some references with <!-- --> under my index.html. Every code that I used from other sites I rewrote myself to get a better understanding.
