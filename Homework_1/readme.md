# Homework_1 Tech Report

Wow! Its been awhile since I last coded so this took me some time and effort to figure some of the basic setups.

I had some trouble remembering which code goes in which place, whether it be the index.html or .css file. Once I realized you must <a href="" your style sheet THEN you may go on to making <divs> and <sections> and style out from there. Its pretty interesting stuff, although very frustrating sometimes!

I think my biggest issue was pushing to master from my Github Desktop. I would write code and push, refresh, and expect a result immediately. But it would typically take 1-2 minutes to update. Thinking I must have done something wrong, I would rewrite. After learning that I need to be more patient with my computer/github, I realized my code was actually correct! For this assignment, I definitely spent multiple hours reading and figuring which code worked through trial and error. The actual code writing didn't take too long.

 Lastly, the syllabus states we must cite code we have used from other websites. I made some references with <!-- --> in my index.html. Most everything I used from other sites was just a reference sheet. I would constantly switch from my atom editor to the site I was using and then write the code myself to get a better understanding.
